## Summary

Hey! My name is Max. I'm 29. I have worked as a software developer about three years. I use PHP as a main programming
language. Not only that, but I like to understand new technologies and, Iâ€™m not afraid of difficult tasks.

I wanna also know JavaScript and solve more tasks, including frontend. I'll be glad to meet new people. Furthermore, I
would like to work in a strong team with such technologies as:

* PHP Symfony;
* JS (React), TS;
* Redis, RabbitMQ;
* Docker;
* DDD;
* CI/CD.
